## Stock Analysis

## Project Overview

### Purpose
The following analysis was completed to compare the annual performance of a select green energy stocks for the years 2017 & 2018. This analysis was programmed using Microsoft Excel VBA code in order to output rapid results for large portions of data for a specified year. 

### Results

#### Conclusion 
  Based on the above results we can determine following:
  1. The refactored code provided a **91.12%** increase in script run time performance for analyzing the **2017** results.
  2. The refactored code provided a **90.68%** increase in script run time performance for analyzing the **2018** results.
  
### Summary

1. Advantages of refactoring code
   - Allows the code to process larger amounts of data in faster processing rate
   - Improves the code design to simplify additions and extensions to the code if needed
   - Improves code efficiency, logic and run time

2. Disadvantages of refactoring code
   - Understanding and interpreting original code in order to make improvements can be time consuming.
   - If the original code is not reusable, writing and developing new code can time consuming and lengthy process.
   - Writing new code enables room new errors, bugs, and other issues.
  
3. As evident by the results of the VBA script timer, refactoring the code for the stock analysis has provided a 91% average increase in program performance. This will allow the program to run efficiently if analysis for additional stock or years are required.
